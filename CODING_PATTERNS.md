## General

### Delete Dead Code

Code comments are an [anti-pattern](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/please-dont-commit-commented-out-code). Always delete dead code. Use [git-diff](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff) to restore old code.

### Avoid Code Comments

Code comments are an [anti-pattern](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/please-dont-commit-commented-out-code). Use [Descriptive and Meaningful Phrases](#descriptive-and-meaningful-phrases) instead.
